# Digiwarped

Digiwarped is a Digimon fan-game produced by digimon fans! You take the role of a human that gets warped into the Digital world and have to save it by finding a digimon partner in time!

The game was initially produced in Adobe Flash for easy browser access and experience but was later transferred to the free Ren'py engine (which also has a browser plug-in). Unfortunately the Flash environment started crashing and support was completely discontinued by Adobe in 2021.
